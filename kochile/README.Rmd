# kochile

`kochile` is made to finish my essay.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `kochile` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chile0126/BBS/kochile")
```

## Example

use `get_all_data ()` to import data that going to be used, which including `d0914`, `d1520`, `dkoh`, `site_bbs`, `site_bbs0914`, `site_bbs1520` and `site_koh`

```{r example, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library (kochile)
library (googledrive)
library (googlesheets4)
get_all_data ()
head (site_koh)
head (d1520)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
